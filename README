Online Multiplayer Car Game prototype in html5/javascript/canvas/webgl for the Hyves Hackaton

A game is developed with 2 cars being simulated using jiglibjs2 physics engine (http://brokstuk.com/jiglibjs2/)

The Three.js 3d library (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

And node.js for the communcation between the players

Assuming you have node and npm:

npm install in this folder to install deps

then 

node app.js

and point 2 browsers at http://localhost:9090

Most obvious improvement from here is to periodically sync the physics simulations for the
relevant objects (the cars in this case), as the simulation goes out of sync very quickly
