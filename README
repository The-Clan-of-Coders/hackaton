Online Multiplayer Car Game prototype in html5/javascript/canvas/webgl for the Hyves Hackaton

A game is developed with 2 cars being simulated using jiglibjs2 physics engine (http://brokstuk.com/jiglibjs2/)

The Three.js 3d library (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

And node.js for the communcation between the players

Assuming you have node and npm:

npm install in this folder to install deps

then 

node app.js

and point 2 browsers at http://localhost:9090

Most obvious improvement from here is to periodically sync the physics simulations for the
relevant objects (the cars in this case), as the simulation goes out of sync very quickly.

I a real game is made, probably a 3d simulation is needed running in the server side, as the single
authoritive simulation, to prevent cheating and to have a single sync point for all players.

Because the server side is written in Node.js, it should be possible to re-use the jiglibjs2 library also on the server.
